# DAY 4 :purple_heart:
## We learned the following topics:
* Started with generics(multiple data types in a single reference).
* [Example](https://github.com/adarshsiva/AndroidWorkshop2019/blob/master/day4/generics/Driver.java) for generics.
* Finally we started off with Android studio :muscle:.
* Introduction to frontend(xml) and backend(Java).
* Different layouts and frontend in detail.
* Android studio docs and how to find particular doc.
* Learned to assign ids to buttons and text boxes.
